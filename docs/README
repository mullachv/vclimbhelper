Run nosetests -s
Three tests must run and none fail
Main file is tracer.py. trace_calls_and_returns method captures the call trace
and return values into two global variables. Use the get*iterator methods
to loop through the results

One can use the trace_calls_and_returns simply by including it in one's code,
for instance, as in calltrace_tests.py file. An example:

<code>
from calltrace import tracer
sys.settrace(tracer.trace_calls_and_returns)

#Call your target method(s)
method2()

#Now simply iterate through the gathered call list or
#result list for what you need to check/verify
for item in tracer.get_calllist_iterator():
    if item[0] == 'method2':
        #method2() is at line 18 of this file
        assert_equal(18, item[1])
        #method2() is called from line 41 in this file
        assert_equal(41, item[3])
        break

tracer.reset()
</code>
